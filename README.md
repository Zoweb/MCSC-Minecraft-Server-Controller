# MinecraftServer
#### **A Minecraft Server GUI**
<br>
Created by [*Zoweb*](https://github.com/zoweb "Zoweb on Github"), MinecraftServer is a *server GUI* made for BungeeCord and Spigot/BuildCraft. It allows easy editing of server settings, and even easier creation of those servers using a simple but powerful GUI. The open-source program is coded in C# and made especially for Windows, and has source code available on Github.
To use it, simply [<s>download</s>](# "Download is not yet available"), install BungeeCord, add a few servers and run! It's *seriously* that easy!
